# Plotting the difference of random generated numbers

This repository is a short experiment of what happens when you plot the difference between each number of a large set 
of random generated numbers

## Dependencies
- Python3

### Packages
- jupyterlab
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Installation

Download this repository and install the package dependencies via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) / [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda/).

## Getting Started

1. Start the jupyter lab in the terminal with ```$ jupyter lab```
2. Open the notebook file ```Notebook.ipynb```

### Options

Altering the variables described below changes the plotted graph.

#### difference.py

You can find two variables in the main function of the ```difference.py``` file:
- quantity - You can change the quantity of numbers to generate here
- maximum_value - You can change the maximum generated value of the numbers here

#### uniform.py

You can find two variables in the main function of the ```uniform.py``` file:
- quantity - You can change the quantity of numbers to generate here
- mu - You can change the mathematical symbol mu's value in the formula
